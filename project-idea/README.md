# :star: Some comment from Androw      
* Building and deploying a machine learning system is often complicated and time-consuming. You have to       
    * collect data, 
    * implement a model or find an appropriate open-source model, 
    * build a data pipeline to get the data to the right place, 
    * develop or find a tool to label the data, 
    * train the model, tune hyperparameters, fix data issues, and 
    * eventually set up a deployment server and 
    * find a way to get the trained model to run on it.

* 深度學習模型研究實戰經驗，神經網絡的設計、debug方法，以及人工智慧算法設計與改進思路。
